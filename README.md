## About Khronos

Khronos is a tool designed to ease time series analytics.
It is aimed to provide fast, memory efficient algorithms and statistical tests.
Linear models (ARMA, SARIMA, ARV...) are available, and Khronos provides function to seamlessly use [Keras.io](https://keras.io) models.
Khronos relies on TensorFlow for computation.
